These are my set of completed programs to the problems from https://data-representation.github.io/problems/go-fundamentals.html
## How to Run The Programs

*Assumeing that Git and Go are installed on the machine you wish to view the programmes on*
**If not, they can be downloaded from https://golang.org/dl/ and https://git-scm.com/downloads 

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
> git clone https://github.com/Eoghan-oconnor/GoProblemsheet_1.git
```
**2. Change Directory to the Folder**

```bash
Open the terminal/command line and navigate into the folder 
eg. > λ cd "Desktop\Folders\College\3rd year\DataRep\GoProblemSheet1\
```

**2. Compile the Program**

```bash
Before you run the program you must compile it using go build 
eg. > go build 02-CurrentTime.go
```

**3. Run the Program**

```bash
Once the go file ahas compiled successfully an .exe will appear, simply enter the file name to run the .exe
λ 10-reversingString.exe

*Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each program to create a unique .exe file for each.
